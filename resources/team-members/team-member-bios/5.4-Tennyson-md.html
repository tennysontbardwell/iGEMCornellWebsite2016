<h2>Tennyson T Bardwell | (Freshman)</h2>
<h4>College: Engineering</h4>
<h4>Major: Computer Science</h4>
<p>This is Tennyson's first year on the team! Technically he's not supposed to have a bio yet, but I'm writing this website so who's going to stop me?</p>
<p>When I was 12 years old I learned AppleScript. The summer before High School I learned C++ and Objective-C, and build a small iPhone app.</p>
<p>I like CS, to build programs and write macros.</p>
