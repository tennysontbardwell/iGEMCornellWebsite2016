<h4>College: Engineering ('18)</h4>
<h4>Major: Chemical Engineering</h4>
<p>I am a Junior studying Chemical Engineering with minors in Business and Biomedical Engineering.  When I am not trapped in Olin or learning new programming languages, I tend to be working in the Study Abroad Office, or building the legendary Phoenix to represent the engineers for Dragon Day.  In my free time I enjoy baking, painting, and knitting, and I have a goldfish that is almost a foot long (yes, it is a goldfish, I promise).</p>
