<h4>College: Engineering ('18)</h4>
<h4>Major: Biological Engineering</h4>
<p>Hello! My name is Saie Ganoo, and I am junior in Biological Engineering. I love the Ithacan outdoors and love this wonderful iGEM team of scientists, innovators, and connectors. Currently, I am involved with research on campus outside of the team as well as the Cornell Hindu Student Council as VP. You can find me on North Campus during the year as an Resident Advisor (RA) and napping outside on a quad during a lovely summer day!  In the future, I would love to continue work in Biomedical Engineering and Materials Science Engineering research fields, and I plan on continuing my education in graduate school.</p>
