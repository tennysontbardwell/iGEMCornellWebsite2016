<h4>College: Human Ecology ('19)</h4>
<h4>Major: Human, Biology, Health, and Society</h4>
<p>I am a sophomore pre-med, majoring in Human Biology, Health, and Society. My research interests include neurobiology, psychology, nutrition, molecular biology, and epigenetics. I am currently involved in research that deals with epigenetic mechanisms, specifically the methylation states, of a specific locus in mice. Outside of academics, I also play volleyball. I played intramural volleyball during the spring, and I also go to open gym volleyball almost every week during the semester. One fun fact about me is that I am normally right-hand dominant, but in some sports, I am left-hand dominant.</p>
