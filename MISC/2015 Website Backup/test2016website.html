						<h2>fishPharm - 2015</h2>
						<p>We created a probiotic treatment to the devastating and hard to-treat salmonid Bacterial Coldwater Disease, which is ubiquitous to fresh water and invades fish farms all over the world and in the U.S. We coupled this treatment with the development of a novel fish tag drug delivery device.

Our engineered cells housed in a hollow fiber reactor filtration device to clean lakes and drinking water. Winner of Gold Medal</p>

					<p>Working in collaboration with Ecovative Design, we created a biodegradable styrofoam replacement from mushrooms, an alternative type of packaging now being used by large companies like IKEA . We hope to develop a toolkit for genetically modifying basidiomycetes like G. lucidum so that other iGEM teams and companies like Ecovative Design will be able to approach genetic modification of higher-order fungi more easily.</p>

					<h2>Safe Bet - 2012</h2>
					<p>We conceived, designed, and constructed a novel biosensor to remotely and continuously monitor arsenic levels in rivers utilizing an electroactive bacterium Shewanella oneidensis that we have genetically modified. This project addressed the lack of a system to continuously monitor water quality in areas affected by oil and gas extraction and is modular as well– the device can be adapted for just about any environment. SAFE BET complements current methods of chemical detection and will pave the way to improved protection of our greatest resource: water.</p>

        <h2>Business</h2>
        <p>The business subteam has two primary roles within Cornell iGEM. First, we establish partnerships and sponsorship with many outside organizations to ensure that the project is financially viable. Second, each year we evaluate the marketability of our project and consider applications of our project to improve existing industry. Our coordination with sponsors and development of business models for Cornell iGEM positions us as the fiscal backbone of the team, helping to bring the team’s project ideas to reality.</p>

        <h2>Computer Science/Electrical and Computer Engineering</h2>
        <p>The CS/ECE Design Team operates at the fusion of synthetic biology and technology.  The team works closely with Product Development in the research and design phases and spearheads all the coding and electrical engineering components of the dry lab product that take our project to the next level.  This includes developing smartphone apps, environmental monitoring systems, and biosensor technology.  In addition, the CS/ECE Design Team creates the competition wiki page and sponsorship video.</p>

        <p>The wet lab subteam integrates myriad ideas and subjects them to rigorous testing and analysis. Using the most advanced techniques in molecular biology and biochemistry, we design novel experiments to purify our therapeutics, to assess their efficacy, and to test their stability. We are committed to making contributions to synthetic biology through the heterologous expression and the characterization of proteins that remain poorly understood.</p>

        <p>The product development subteam is an end-to-end product development team that is user centered and engineering focused, with the end goal of bringing Cornell iGEM's biological engineering technology to the real world. We apply design thinking and various engineering disciplines to explore user needs, generate a problem statement, design and prototype a mechanical solution to the problem, and create product specifications and prepare for manufacture.</p>

The subteam coordinates outreach events such as youth mentorship programs, forums, and expos. Policy and Practices also analyzes policies, and connects those who are familiar and unfamiliar to our project. Through interviews with field experts and interactions with the public, we are reminded that the people we meet always have stories to tell. We aim to share our story with them, too.</p>

Hailing from Tennessee, with a subtle Southern drawl, Saie appears to be cute and collected, but beware: even though she may be slightly on the short side, she\u2019s full of spunk. At night, she lives a double life, staying up until 3AM befriending often clueless high schoolers as a residential advisor and sending cool emails with lots of random pictures off the internet. By day, you can find her snapchatting in wet lab, jamming out to the best of the best (aka High School Musical and the Jonas Brothers. No shame. You can admit that you like them too; she won\u2019t judge.), all while casually inserting genes into plasmids with success. She co-leads the policy and practices subteam as well, determined to save every salmon in upstate New York. So how does she do it all? She may be busy, but don\u2019t fear. She\u2019ll always be there to comfort you with Netflix on those days where you want to stay in bed for 10 hours.

He merely sees them as challenges that builds character. (Hell, he evens cooks his meal, and he cooks it better than my mom does, whats up with that?) He knows that one day the mountains will be moved, the foes will be vanquished, and the sea departs to make way for him toward that stockpile of Nobel prices that is his birthright. And so he waits. He pipets. He autoclaves. He transforms. He only sleeps during the few hours of incubation.

An active member of CRU and close friends with Bill Nye the science dude, Grace is basically a manifestation of the positivity and friendliness exuded by a playful breeze on an Ithacan summer\u2019s day. Her loyalty, however, isn\u2019t fickle like the winds of the Northeast; rather, she finds herself at all hours tirelessly working in the lab, often jamming to numerous sick beats, until we have to physically kidnap her and dose her with Starbucks to bring her back to the real world. She co-leads the Policy and Practices subteam and is ready to cure the world\u2019s diseases. A master of photography, you can find this kind soul wandering through gardens and Farmer\u2019s Markets, trying to catch the sunlight in just the right way, before she captures an image only surpassed by a Van Gogh.<\/p>"}

As she emits her radiant demeanor, all hints of evil contaminants shall be vanquished from her LB. As she exudes her joyous energy, all traces of negative emotions shall simply dissipate. Yes, her mere presence will be the sun that illuminates the darkness and fills the void that threatens to swallow the Cornell iGEM lab. Be it her unique tastes in music, or her peerless and impeccable cloning techniques, or her complete calmness in the presence of dangerous flying insects, she will imbue us with hope and strength to obliterate the peptidoglycan fortresses that stand against our mission. However, all of this conceal her true talent as a visionary and creator. With those animations so dynamic, so vibrant, she will surely lead us to victory.

For decades, we studied his patterns, learned his ways. Rishabh, despite an eternity of wisdom, had devolved into a creature of habit, frequenting a small nearby establishment named \"\"Taco Bell\"\". The creature also displayed a certain affinity towards \"\"rap\"\" music, though our research team had yet to deciphering its meaning. When the time had come, our scouts tracked his last known location to Ithaca, where he had blended into the student populace; more specifically, the Cornell iGEM team. Tracking down Rishabh's lair was mere child's play; our crew commanded the best hunters in the known quadrant. And so we infiltrated and laid in wait, hoping to find the perfect moment to strike.\nBut so was he. \nIn my hubris, I underestimated the might of the ancient powers, at the cost of my crew's lives.
