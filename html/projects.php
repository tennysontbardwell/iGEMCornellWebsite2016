						<h2>fishPharm - 2015</h2>
						<p>We created a probiotic treatment to the devastating and hard to-treat salmonid Bacterial Coldwater Disease, which is ubiquitous to fresh water and invades fish farms all over the world and in the U.S. We coupled this treatment with the development of a novel fish tag drug delivery device.  Winner of Gold Medal, Best Environmental, Best Business, and Best Applied Design.</p>

					<h2>Lead it Go - 2014</h2>
					<p>We engineered a novel heavy metal sequestration and filtration system for lead, nickel, and mercury remediation in which we engineered bacterial strains to express heavy metal transport proteins and metallothioneins to bind to the metals in polluted water. Our engineered cells housed in a hollow fiber reactor filtration device to clean lakes and drinking water. Winner of Gold Medal</p>

					<h2>Organofoam - 2013</h2>
					<p>Working in collaboration with Ecovative Design, we created a biodegradable styrofoam replacement from mushrooms, an alternative type of packaging now being used by large companies like IKEA . We hope to develop a toolkit for genetically modifying basidiomycetes like G. lucidum so that other iGEM teams and companies like Ecovative Design will be able to approach genetic modification of higher-order fungi more easily.</p>

					<h2>Safe Bet - 2012</h2>
					<p>We conceived, designed, and constructed a novel biosensor to remotely and continuously monitor arsenic levels in rivers utilizing an electroactive bacterium Shewanella oneidensis that we have genetically modified. This project addressed the lack of a system to continuously monitor water quality in areas affected by oil and gas extraction and is modular as wellâ€“ the device can be adapted for just about any environment. SAFE BET complements current methods of chemical detection and will pave the way to improved protection of our greatest resource: water.</p>
