<h4>College: Arts and Scienes ('18)</h4>
<h4>Major: Biology (Microbiology)</h4>
<p>I'm a biology major concentrating in microbiology, and I'm entering my junior year. I'm interested in microbial ecology, both human and soil. I play on Cornell's women's ultimate frisbee team, so hit me up if you ever want to toss! Fun fact about me is I plan to live in Iceland one day because it is one of the most beautiful places in the world.</p>
