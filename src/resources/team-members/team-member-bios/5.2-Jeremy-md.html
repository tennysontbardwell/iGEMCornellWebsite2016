<h4>College: Engineering ('17)</h4>
<h4>Major: Biomechanical Engineering</h4>
<p>I am a Mechanical Engineering major focusing on Biomedical Engineering and the integration of robotics and medicine. Graduating in the Spring of 2017, I currently work on iGem's Product Development team. I am also Officer of External Affairs for the Cornell Fishing club and a volunteer at Schuyler Humane Society. When I'm not inhaling ice cream at the dairy bar, you can find me fishing around campus or in nearby Ithaca.</p>
