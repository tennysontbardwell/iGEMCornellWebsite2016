<h4>College: Engineering ('19)</h4>
<h4>Major: Unaffiliated </h4>
<p>I first joined Cornell iGEM as a freshman in Spring. Now a sophomore, I love being a member of the business team. Around campus, I also enjoy participating in ChemE Car and Women In Coding at Cornell. Eating as much ice cream as I possibly can, spending time with friends,  running to catch the TCAT, and biking on those few good weather days are my favorite things to do in Ithaca. I am currently unaffiliated in the College of Engineering, considering a major in Computer Science. A fun fact about me -- I have been in the bull ring during the Festival of San Fermin!</p>
