<h4>College: Engineering ('19)</h4>
<h4>Major: Biomedical Engineering</h4>
<p>I am a sophomore at Cornell in the College of Engineering and am planning on majoring in Biomedical Engineering.  In addition to being a member of the iGEM team on campus, I am an undergraduate researcher in the Schaffer-Nishimura lab studying cancer metastasis in the brain. Fun Fact: When I was young, my dream job was to become a singer...until I realized that I am horrible at singing.</p>
