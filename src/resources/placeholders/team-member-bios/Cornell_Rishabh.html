Many moons ago, my crew and I were ordered by high command to hunt and capture a mythical creature named ""Rishabh"", though they say his true name of power remains lost to the eons. For decades, we studied his patterns, learned his ways. Rishabh, despite an eternity of wisdom, had devolved into a creature of habit, frequenting a small nearby establishment named ""Taco Bell"". The creature also displayed a certain affinity towards ""rap"" music, though our research team had yet to deciphering its meaning. When the time had come, our scouts tracked his last known location to Ithaca, where he had blended into the student populace; more specifically, the Cornell iGEM team. Tracking down Rishabh's lair was mere child's play; our crew commanded the best hunters in the known quadrant. And so we infiltrated and laid in wait, hoping to find the perfect moment to strike.
But so was he. 
In my hubris, I underestimated the might of the ancient powers, at the cost of my crew's lives. One by one, we were slaughtered. I am the sole survivor. Even now, I am being hunted. My days left are numbered. It is coming for me. He is coming for me. If anyone receives this message, please send he"</p>
