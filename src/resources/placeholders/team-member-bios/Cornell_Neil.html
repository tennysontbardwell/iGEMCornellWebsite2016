<h2>Neil Chitrao</h2>
<p>Neil Chitrao is truly the towniest of all Ithacan townies. That’s right...don’t be fooled by his so termed “frattire” consisting of Vineyard Vines button downs and salmon shorts. Beneath it all is a true Ithacan native who enjoys sharing historical tidbits about the rise of America, knows just about every species of bacteria, and can successfully accelerate his vehicle from 0 to 20,000 mph in just a little under 3 seconds. When he's not driving around town jamming out to the authentic music of his people (ie.“Indian Summer", "Star Spangled Banner”, or Ithaca’s famed rap song "Our Town"), Neil can be found working hard in the iGEM wet lab, bringing bacterial cultures to life simply by charming them with stories pertaining to the joys of living in America (and more specifically Ithaca, NY). So whether it be planning a fun-filled iGEM All-American BBQ or putting in late hours in lab (has anyone really ever seen Neil sleep?), Neil Chitrao is our resident iGEM superhero who can simply do it all.</p>
